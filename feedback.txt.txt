## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses / Gaps
1. **Tokenizer persistence:**  
   - You‚Äôre saving only `special_tokens` in checkpoints, not the full tokenizer model. Inference reloads from `./tokenizer_data`, which assumes the directory is always present. If you move the checkpoint to another machine, it‚Äôll break unless you also copy the tokenizer folder.  
   - Fix: bundle the tokenizer files (vocab + merges) into the checkpoint or zip them alongside.

2. **Validation split assumption:**  
   - In streaming mode you assume a `validation` split exists. Many HF datasets don‚Äôt. That‚Äôll throw errors.  
   - Fix: fall back to slicing off a portion of `train` if `validation` isn‚Äôt available.

3. **Spelling conversion edge cases:**  
   - Words like `program` ‚Üí `programme` will mangle computing contexts. You‚Äôll want an exceptions list (e.g. ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù, ‚Äúparameters‚Äù, ‚Äúthermometer‚Äù).  
   - Otherwise you‚Äôll corrupt code/data‚Äëheavy corpora.

4. **Training loop iteration logic:**  
   - `get_batch` relies on `next(self.train_iter)` with no shuffling between epochs. For local datasets, that means deterministic order unless you wrap in a `RandomSampler`.  
   - Fix: use `DataLoader(..., shuffle=True)` for local tensor datasets.

5. **Model architecture:**  
   - You‚Äôre still calling it `BigramLanguageModel`, but it‚Äôs now a multi‚Äëlayer transformer. The name is misleading.  
   - Consider renaming to `TinyTransformerLM` or similar.

6. **Inference UX:**  
   - Right now the chat loop just echoes raw generations. You could improve readability by truncating at `<EOT>` and re‚Äëprompting with role tags (`<USR>`, `<ASSIST>`). You‚Äôve got the machinery, just need to enforce it.

## üõ† Actionable Improvements
- **Checkpointing:** Save tokenizer files with the checkpoint (or at least document that both must travel together).  
- **Validation fallback:** Add a try/except around `StreamingTextDataset(..., split='validation')` and fallback to slicing train.  
- **Spelling exceptions:** Add a small `EXCEPTIONS` set to skip replacements in technical contexts.  
- **DataLoader shuffle:** For local datasets, wrap in `DataLoader(..., shuffle=True)` to avoid overfitting to sequence order.  
- **Naming clarity:** Rename `BigramLanguageModel` to reflect its actual transformer nature.  
- **Inference polish:** Enforce `<EOT>` truncation and role‚Äëtag prompting for cleaner chat experience.
