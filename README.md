This project, "quantaTinyLLM", is an educational and experimental implementation of a small-scale Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. It is designed for ease of understanding, execution, and modification, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "Let's build GPT" and bdunaganGPT.

The core functionality involves building, training, and performing inference with a basic language model.

Key components and their functions:

*   README.md: Provides a comprehensive overview, detailing features like Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), robust checkpointing, resumable training, a clear workflow, and portability to Google Colab. It indicates that "quantaTinyLLM.ipynb" is the main file.

*   model.py: Defines the TinyTransformerLM architecture, including FeedForward networks, Transformer Blocks (with MultiheadAttention and LayerNorm), token and position embeddings, and a language model head. It also includes a text generation method.

*   tokenizer.py: Implements a CustomTokenizer using ByteLevelBPETokenizer. It handles training, loading, encoding, and decoding text, and defines special tokens like <USR>, <ASSIST>, <EOT>, and <PAD>.

*   train_llm.py: The primary script for model training.
    *   Configuration: Allows selection of 'local' or 'huggingface' data sources, specifies paths, and defines model/training hyperparameters.
    *   Data Loading and Preprocessing: Manages data loading from local files or Hugging Face datasets. It includes logic for tokenizer training/loading and a StreamingTextDataset for efficient handling of large datasets, with an option for Australian English spelling conversion.
    *   Trainer Class: Manages the training loop, incorporating checkpointing (including saving the best model), learning rate scheduling (warmup and cosine decay), mixed precision training (AMP), and gradient clipping.

*   inference.py: A standalone script for running text generation.
    *   Configuration: Sets parameters for generation (MAX_NEW_TOKENS, TEMPERATURE, TOP_K, TOP_P).
    *   Model Loading: Loads the trained model and tokenizer from a checkpoint.
    *   Text Generation: Features a generate_with_sampling function supporting various sampling strategies and stopping at the <EOT> token.
    *   Interactive Chat Loop: Provides a command-line interface for interactive text generation using special role-playing tokens.

*   convert_spelling.py: Contains a utility function, convert_text_to_au_english, integrated into the data preprocessing pipeline.

*   aggregate_code.bat: A batch script to concatenate core Python files into aggregated_code_for_review.txt for easy review.

*   .gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as PyTorch model checkpoints (*.pth).

*   feedback.txt.txt: A file likely containing project feedback or notes.

*   quantaTinyLLM.txt: Its name suggests it could be a local dataset or a reference to the project's name, with the README indicating a Jupyter Notebook as the main interface.

In essence, quantaTinyLLM is a comprehensive, self-contained educational tool for understanding and experimenting with small transformer-based language models, emphasizing clarity, portability, and ease of modification, likely within an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.
